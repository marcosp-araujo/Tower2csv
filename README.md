# Tower2csv
The "Tower2csv.py" class converts and joins netcdf-files from the Tall Tower database for a given input year into a csv file.
An example of how to use it is in the "main.py" file.

Basically, the Tower2csv requires three STRING inputs:
1 - netcdf_dir = Directory of netcdf files
2 - year = Year of data to be joined and converted
