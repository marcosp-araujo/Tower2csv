# Tower2csv
The "Tower2csv.py" class converts and joins netcdf-files from the Tall Tower database for a given input year into a csv file.
An example of how to use it is in the "main.py" file.

Basically, the Tower2csv requires three STRING inputs:
1 - netcdf_dir = Directory of netcdf files
2 - year = Year of data to be joined and converted
3 - save_dir = save_dir  Directory to save the .csv

Data from the OWEZ offshore meteorological tower are used as example. They were dowloaded in the following link:
https://talltowers.bsc.es/access-the-data

In the link above, search for "Egmond aan zee" in the field "Tower name". Then, click on the station in the map, and after that, click on "Access to data: b2share". Then, you will download the "owez.zip" file with the data.

The data are in folder called '10minutely':
